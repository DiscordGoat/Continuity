Smithing:
(Smithing Changes:
New Anvil button: Reforge.
Reforge button attempts to reforge the item to the next Tier reforge, provided the previous Tier is present, and the minimum amount of mats are in the billitem slot.
Reforge attempts cost materials equal to the reforge tier being rolled.
Base roll success chance is 0%. New Talents are required to increase this chance and decrease the mats count.
Base mats amount is 64.

mats:
Common: Requires Cobblestone
Uncommon: Requires Iron
Rare: Requires Gold
Epic: Requires Amethyst
Legendary: Requires Diamond

clicking the Reforge button checks:
isSword/Tool/Armor/Bow: else return;
isNotMaxReforgeTier: else return;
matsPresent: else return;
if(roll = success){
subtract mats
update reforge
grant 2000 Smithing xp
play victory sound and particles
close inventory
}else{
subtract mats
damage item by 50% its durability
degrade anvil quality
close inventory
}
Smithing Talents can increase the odds of a successful roll for Reforging, or reducing the Mats Count required.
example: with no talents, reforging a sword to a sturdy sword (tier 1 reforge) costs 64 cobblestone and has a 0% chance of success.
the previous reforge smithing items (sold by armorsmiths, weaponsmiths and toolsmiths) will be removed from the trades.
For Clarification purposes, the Alloy perks can all activate at the same time, if RNG allows, but all are active if purchased. this means that the player has a 30% chance to gain SOME max durability, but only a 6% chance of it being
a specific amount.
